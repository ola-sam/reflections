How did viewing a diff between two versions of a file help you see the bug that 
was introduced?
Viewing the diff made the comparison easier as it collates and presents the code lines that 
changed in comparison with the old version of the file.


How could having easy access to the entire history of a file make you a more
efficient programmer in the long term?
Having access to the history of a file will save me tons of time and hours trying to debug
error in my codes. This will also be very good for team work expecially to track contributions
and the risk and fear of codes being messed up in the process of collaboration will be elimated. 


What do you think are the pros and cons of manually choosing when to create a
commit, like you do in Git, vs having versions automatically saved, like Google
docs does?
Pros of manual commit:
This will make commits more meaningful, not too big or too small, 
easy reference preview of changes and bugs fixed
Cons of manual commit:
It is easier to forget to commit which could be gravely late.
Time taking to commit on each changes and bugs fixed


Why do you think some version control systems, like Git, allow saving multiple
files in one commit, while others, like Google Docs, treat each file separately?
Git allows multiple files in one commit because a project might involve different
coding language like html and css. So a change across the files or on one of the files
can be committed.
Other files like Googledoc sees each file separately. 


How can you use the commands git log and git diff to view the history of files?
first, you change git directory to the file home directory like: 
cd version-control/reflections
Git log will show all the commit on the file
Git diff will show all the addition and deletion on the files



How might using version control make you more confident to make changes that
could break something?
git checkout can be used to restore or revert to previous version without the bug. 
git diff can be used to trace the bug.



Now that you have your workspace set up, what do you want to try using Git for?
Using Git for my data analysis projects
Using Git for collaboration
